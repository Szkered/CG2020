#+TITLE: Computational Conformal Geometry 2020 Summer School
* Installation on Ubuntu / PopOS
** freeglut
The freeglut provided was for Windows (.dll), so we need to obtain our own freeglut:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev
   #+END_SRC
** MeshLib
I modified some code in the MeshLib as it was build for window.
1. ~typename~ in template return type declaration.
2. ~#include <deque>~
3. cast the ~__unary_op~ to appropriate type in ~std::transform~: ~transform(t.begin(), t.end(), t.begin(), ptr_fun<int, int>(tolower));~
4. Naming conflict in ~CutGraphMesh.h~
